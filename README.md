**Deep Sketch Hashing: Fast Free-hand Sketch-Based Image Retrieval**
- by Li Liu, Fumin Shen, Yuming Shen, Xianglong Liu and Ling Shao

to be presented on CVPR 2017 spotlight section for fast sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR).

## Prerequisites
To produce the binary codes described in the paper, one needs to install [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) beforehand.

## Models
We provide several pretrained models on two datasets with their respective deploy files. You may try to use any of these models to produce hash code for image-sketch matching.

### [Sketchy Dataset](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) (Extended)
- 32 bits
- 64 bits
- 128 bits
- 256 bits

### [TU Berlin Sketch Dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/)
- 32 bits
- 64 bits
- 128 bits
- 256 bits
